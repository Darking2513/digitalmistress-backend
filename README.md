# DigitalMistress Backend

This repository contains backend services for the DigitalMistress platform.

## Purpose
The backend is responsible for functionality that should live outside of Webflow, including:
- Authentication & user identity
- Secure API endpoints
- Server-side logic
- Integrations with third-party services
- Security and data validation

## Current Status
This repository is intentionally minimal.

No production code has been committed yet.  
The initial goal is architecture review and planning before implementation.

## Expectations
During the initial evaluation period, work may include:
- Reviewing the overall system architecture
- Identifying what backend services are required
- Defining authentication and security strategy
- Proposing folder structure and tech stack
- Outlining data flow between frontend and backend

## Notes
- No secrets, credentials, or keys should ever be committed
- AWS access will be granted only after approval
- All implementation decisions should be discussed before execution
